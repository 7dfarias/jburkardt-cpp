      PCL_READ <br> Extract Numeric Data from a PCL File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PCL_READ</b>
      is a C++ program which
      extracts numeric data from
      a PCL file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main reason for doing this is so that the
      resulting file can easily be read by a program as pure numeric data.
      The PCL files we are considering contain gene expression data
      from experiments on Arabidopsis.  The first line of the file contains
      a (long) list of labels.  There follow N records, each containing
      3 labels and 14 numeric values, separated by TAB characters.
      PCL_READ reads this data, ignoring the title and labels, and writes
      N records of numeric data to a new text file.
