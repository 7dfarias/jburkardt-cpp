      TIMESTAMP <br> Print a Timestamp

    <p>
      <b>TIMESTAMP</b>
      is a C++ library which
      can print or return the current YMDHMS date as a timestamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is useful when documenting the run of a program.  By
      including a timestamp, the output of the program will always
      contain a clear indication of when it was created.  Other
      indicators, such as the file timestamp, may be misleading
      or subject to unintentional modification.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TIMESTAMP</b> simply gives the current time.  If you are
      trying to do careful timings of the speed of execution of
      a computer code, this may not be very accurate, especially
      on a computer that uses timesharing.  In that case, there
      are better solutions that measure just the CPU time
      associated with your process.
