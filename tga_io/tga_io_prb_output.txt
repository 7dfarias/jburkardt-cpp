TGA_IO_PRB
  C++ version
  Simple tests of the TGA_IO library.

  The TGA_BYTE_SWAP option being used is 1

TEST01:
  TGA_READ can read a TGA file.
  Here, we read the file "earth.tga".

  ID_LENGTH = 0
  COLOR_MAP_TYPE = 0
  IMAGE_TYPE = 2
  COLOR_MAP_ORIGIN = 0
  COLOR_MAP_LENGTH = 0
  COLOR_MAP_ENTRY_SIZE = 0
  IMAGE_X_ORIGIN = 0
  IMAGE_Y_ORIGIN = 0
  IMAGE_WIDTH = 512
  IMAGE_HEIGHT= 512
  IMAGE_PIXEL_DEPTH = 24
  IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR = 0
  IMAGE_ID = "NULL"

TEST01:
  TGA_READ can read a TGA file.
  Here, we read the file "shuttle.tga".
  This program can't read IMAGE_TYPE 10 files.

  ID_LENGTH = 0
  COLOR_MAP_TYPE = 0
  IMAGE_TYPE = 10
  COLOR_MAP_ORIGIN = 0
  COLOR_MAP_LENGTH = 0
  COLOR_MAP_ENTRY_SIZE = 0
  IMAGE_X_ORIGIN = 0
  IMAGE_Y_ORIGIN = 0
  IMAGE_WIDTH = 640
  IMAGE_HEIGHT= 480
  IMAGE_PIXEL_DEPTH = 24
  IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR = 0
  IMAGE_ID = "NULL"

TEST02:
  TGA_WRITE can write a TGA file.

  Call TGA_READ to read "earth.tga".

  ID_LENGTH = 0
  COLOR_MAP_TYPE = 0
  IMAGE_TYPE = 2
  COLOR_MAP_ORIGIN = 0
  COLOR_MAP_LENGTH = 0
  COLOR_MAP_ENTRY_SIZE = 0
  IMAGE_X_ORIGIN = 0
  IMAGE_Y_ORIGIN = 0
  IMAGE_WIDTH = 512
  IMAGE_HEIGHT= 512
  IMAGE_PIXEL_DEPTH = 24
  IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR = 0
  IMAGE_ID = "NULL"

  Now write the data to "earth_copy.tga".

TGA_IO_PRB:
  Normal end of execution.
