      VECTOR_READ <br> Turn Lines of Text into Numeric Vectors
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>VECTOR_READ</b>
      is a C++ library which
      can read, one line at a time, lines of text from a file, getting the
      numeric data and storing it in a vector returned to the user;
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>VECTOR_READ</b> could be useful, for instance, if you have a
      program which needs to read an unknown number of lines of text,
      doing something after reading each line, and stopping when there
      is no more input.  The lines of text must be presumed to be
      "vectors", that is, lists of integers or real numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the user program will simply open the input file and pass
      a reference to <b>VECTOR_READ</b>, it will read the next line,
      figure out how many items of data are on that line, create
      an array of the appropriate size into which it reads the data,
      and then returns a pointer to the data so that the user can
      process it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just to be clear, here is an example of an input file that
      <b>VECTOR_READ</b> could read.  Note that blank lines and
      lines beginning with "#" are ignored:
      <pre><code>
# vector_read.inp
#
#  Lines beginning with a sharp sign are comments.
#
1 2 3 4 5
#
#  Blank lines should also be ignored.
#

10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
123456789
-1 2 -3 4 -5 6 -7 8 -9 10 -11 12 -13 14
                        999999

 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first time <b>VECTOR_READ</b> is called, it will return
      the value <i>5</i> and a pointer to a vector containing
      (1,2,3,4,5).  The second time, it will return <i>3</i>, and
      a pointer to (9,8,7), and so on.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <i>n</i> = <b>ivec_read</b> ( &amp;<i>input</i>, &amp;<i>ivec</i> );
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads information from the file stream referenced by
          <i>input</i>, and returns <i>n</i>, the number of integer
          items, and <i>ivec</i>, the address of the vector storing
          the integer data.
