    <p>
      <b>OFF2PLC</b>
      is a C++ program which
      reads an OFF file describing a surface in 3D, and creates an equivalent
      PLC file, by Alex Rand.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>off2plc</b> <i>file</i>.off
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <dt>
          <i>file</i>.off is the name of the OFF file to be converted.
        </li>
      </ul>
