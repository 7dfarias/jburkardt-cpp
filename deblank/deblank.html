      DEBLANK <br> Remove blank lines from a file
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DEBLANK</b>
      is a C++ program which
      makes a copy of a text file
      in which all blank lines have been removed.
    </p>

    <p>
      A blank line contains no characters, or else nothing but blank
      characters.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the final line of the input file isn't blank, but does not
      terminate with a NEWLINE character, the corresponding line in
      the output file will have a terminating NEWLINE appended to it.
      A previous version of this program would instead inadvertently
      omit this final line from the output file.
    </p>
