HEX_GRID_DATASET (C++ version)
  Generate a hexagonal grid dataset.

  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.

  The program requests input values from the user:

  * X1, Y1, the lower left corner of the region,
  * X2, Y2, the upper right corner of the region,
  * NODES_PER_LAYER, the number of nodes per layer,

  After the dataset of nodes is computed, it is
  written to a file, and another dataset may be made.
  *
 *
*  Ready to generate a new dataset:
 *
  *

  Enter X1, Y1, the lower left corner of the region:
  (Try '0, 0' if you do not have a preference.)
  (Enter "*" or "QUIT" to terminate execution.)
  User input X1 = 1  Y1 = 2

  Enter X2, Y2, the upper right corner of the region:
  (Try '10, 10' if you do not have a preference.)
  (Enter "*" or "QUIT" to terminate execution.)
  User input X2 = 4  Y2 = 7

  Enter NODES_PER_LAYER, the number of nodes in a layer.
  (Try '10' if you do not have a preference.)
  (1 or any smaller value terminates execution).
  User input NODES_PER_LAYER = 10

  The number of layers will be 18
  The X spacing will be 0.333333
  The Y spacing will be 0.288675
  The number of nodes 171
      10   18     171  hex_grid_10_18_171.txt

  The data was written to the file "hex_grid_10_18_171.txt".

  Enter "Y" if you want to define another dataset.

HEX_GRID_DATASET:
  Normal end of execution.
