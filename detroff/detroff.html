      DETROFF <br> Remove Backspace+Character Combinations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DETROFF</b>
      is a C++ program which
      makes a copy of a file from which all pairs of backspace+character 
      have been removed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given the string of 8 characters:
      <blockquote><code>
        AB#C#DE
      </code></blockquote>
      where we are using "#" to represent a backspace, the returned string
      will be
      <blockquote><code>
        AE
      </code></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      This function was originally written for use in "cleaning up" MAN pages
      so that they would print properly.
      These MAN pages were formatted in the Paleolithic and Byzantine TROFF printing format.
      Although the files were text, and would seem to "print" correctly to
      the screen, an unholy mess would emerge if the same file was sent
      to the printer.  This is because the screen handled the backspaces
      by backspacing, but most printers don't know anymore how to handle
      TROFF's backspaces, and so they just print them as blobs, instead of,
      say, spacing back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Passages which are to be underlined were written so:
      <blockquote><code>
        _#T_#e_#x_#t
      </code></blockquote>
      when what is meant is that "Text" is to be underlined if possible.  
      Note that the seemingly equivalent
      <blockquote><code>
        T#_e#_x#_t#_
      </code></blockquote>
      is NOT used.  This is because, in the olden
      days, certain screen terminals could backspace, but would only
      display the new character, obliterating rather than
      overwriting the old one.  This convention allows us to know
      that we want to delete "character" + Backspace, rather than
      Backspace + "character".
    </p>

    <p>
      Passages which are meant to be in BOLDFACE are written so:
      <blockquote><code>
        U#U#U#Ug#g#g#gl#l#l#ly#y#y#y
      </code></blockquote>
      when what is meant is that
      "Ugly" is to be printed as boldly as possible.  These boldface
      passages may also be cleaned up using the same rule of
      removing all occurrences of "character" + Backspace.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is truly a fright to look at the text of one of these MAN
      pages with all the ugly Backspace's, which sometimes display as ^H
      or as a reverse-video bugsplat.
