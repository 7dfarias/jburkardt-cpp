      ANN <br> Approximate Nearest Neighbors

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ANN</b>
      is a C++ library which
      computes approximate nearest neighbors,
      by David Mount and Sunil Arya.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>ANN</b> is a library written in the C++ programming language to
      support both exact and approximate nearest neighbor searching in
      spaces of various dimensions.  It was implemented by David M. Mount
      of the University of Maryland, and Sunil Arya of the Hong Kong
      University of Science and Technology.  <b>ANN</b> stands for "Approximate
      Nearest Neighbors".  <b>ANN</b> is also a testbed containing programs
      and procedures for generating data sets, collecting and analyzing
      statistics on the performance of nearest neighbor algorithms and
      data structures, and visualizing the geometric structure of these
      data structures.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the nearest neighbor problem a set P of data points in d-dimensional
      space is given.  These points are preprocessed into a data structure, so
      that given any query point q, the nearest (or generally k nearest) points
      of P to q can be reported efficiently.  <b>ANN</b> is designed for
      data sets that are small enough that the search structure can be stored
      in main memory (in contrast to approaches from databases that assume
      that the data resides in secondary storage).  The distance between two
      points can be defined in many ways.  <b>ANN</b> assumes that distances
      are measured using any class of distance functions called Minkowski
      metrics.  These include the well-known Euclidean distance, Manhattan
      distance, and max distance.
