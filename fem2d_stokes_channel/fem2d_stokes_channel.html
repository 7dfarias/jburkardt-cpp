      FEM2D_STOKES_CHANNEL <br> A 2D Stokes Problem in a Channel
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_STOKES_CHANNEL</b> is a C++ library which
      defines the channel problem for use with the FEM2D_STOKES solver.
      The channel is a rectangular region that is 3 units wide and 1 unit
      high.  It is used as a sample problem for the Stokes solver.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To run the problem directly, you only need the user-supplied routines
      in <b>channel.cpp</b>, the node data in <b>nodes6.txt</b>, and the
      element data in <b>triangles6.txt</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You compile and link the Stokes solver with <b>channel.cpp</b>, using
      commands like:
      <pre>
        g++ fem2d_stokes.cpp channel.cpp
        mv a.out channel
      </pre>
      and then run the program with the command
      <pre>
        ./channel nodes6.txt triangles6.txt
      </pre>
    </p>

      The pressures are associated with a subset of the full set of
      nodes, and with an order 3 triangulation of those nodes.
      Note that, in the order 3 triangulation, the nodes are renumbered,
      and do NOT inherit the labels used in the order 6 triangulation.
