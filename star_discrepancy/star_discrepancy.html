      STAR_DISCREPANCY <br> The Star Discrepancy of a Pointset
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>STAR_DISCREPANCY</b>
      is a C++ program which
      computes bounds on the star discrepancy of an M-dimensional set of N points contained
      in the unit hypercube,
      by Eric Thiemard.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pointset is stored in a file, in the TABLE format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The star discrepancy is a commonly cited statistic for
      determining how uniformly a pointset is distributed over a
      region.  For convenience, this region is usually taken as
      the unit hypercube; <b>STAR_DISCREPANCY</b> will assume that
      datasets under investigation are meant to fill up the unit
      hypercube.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the pointset to be investigated actually
      lies in some other hypercube, a simply translation and rescaling
      may be enough to transform the data.  This will probably NOT
      be satisfactory if the original region is rectangular, but
      has sides of different length, or if the region is not rectangular.
    </p>

     <p>
      The discrepancy measures the worst error
      that would be made in estimating the area of a subregion of
      the hypercube by simply noting the fraction of the pointset
      contained in the subregion.  If arbitrary subregions were allowed,
      then it would always be possible to make this error equal to 1
      (just take the region consisting of the hypercube minus the
      pointset.)  Since any "reasonable" area can be arbitrarily well
      approximated by rectangles, the star discrepancy calculation
      uses only rectangular subregions, whose sides are aligned with
      coordinates directions, and one of whose corners is at the origin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Formally, the star discrepancy of a pointset of <b>n</b> points
      is symbolized by <b>D<sub>n</sub><sup>*</sup></b> and defined as
      <blockquote><b>
        D<sub>n</sub><sup>*</sup> = supremum ( P in I* )
          | ( A(P,x) / n ) - lambda ( P ) |
      </b></blockquote>
      Here, <b>I*</b> is the set of all M-dimensional subintervals of the
      form [0,p1] x [0,p2] x ... x [0,ps] where every <b>p</b> is between
      0 and 1; <b>P</b> is any such subinterval; <b>lambda(P)</b> is the
      volume of the subinterval, <b>A(P,x)</b> is the number of points of
      the point set <b>x</b> that occur in <b>P</b>, and <b>n</b>
      is the number of points in <b>x</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearly, the star discrepancy is measuring how badly the pointset
      estimates the volume of a subinterval.  This worst error is somewhere
      between 0 (absolutely no error ever) and 1 (totally missing the
      volume of the unit hypercube).  A value of 0.25, for instance,
      means that there is a subinterval in the unit hypercube for which
      the difference between its true and estimated volumes is 0.25.
      (It might have a volume of 0.80, and be estimated at 0.55, for
      instance, or a volume of 0.05 that is estimated at 0.30.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The original program is by Eric Thiemard.  Changes have been
      made to the program so that it compiles under C++, uses a simpler
      datafile format, and infers the dimensionality of the data from
      the information in the datafile.
